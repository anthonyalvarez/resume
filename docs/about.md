# Resume

This is meant to be a silly side project where I attempt to house & _hopefully, update_ my resume here.

The resume would be in [JSONResume format](https://jsonresume.org/).

More precisely, the goal is to build a (separate) GitHub action that would export my resume here into HTML / PDF and publish it as [a GitHub page](https://pages.github.com/).

> This would mean my resume is nicely located at https://anthonyalvarez.github.io/resume

## But wait...

_JSONResume already offers a central service to publish your resume. Could we not have just used that?_ :man_shrugging:

Good idea! Indeed we could, as can be [seen on their documentation here](https://jsonresume.org/themes/#themes:~:text=If%20you%20are%20using%20the%20registry,http%3A%2F%2Fregistry.jsonresume.org%2Fthomasdavis%3Ftheme%3Dflat).

However, I thought I'll do it myself using a GitHub action in the name of random fun and education, because why not? :nerd_face:

## Generating

 > NOTE: manual, _for now_
